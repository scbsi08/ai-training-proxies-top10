## Practical Cases

Here I'll demonstrate data scraping with Bright Data, Oxylabs, and ThorData, analyzing the crawling process.

### 1. Bright Data

Bright Data is very friendly to new users, offering $2 free credit to experience any proxyâ€”really nice! Its Web Scraper API supports 120+ common websites like Amazon, TikTok, Facebook, X, and provides ready-made datasets for direct customization. Recently they launched MCP service, letting me scrape data directly within development tools or Agents.

**Free Credit for New Users**

After registering a Bright Data official account, log into the control panel. In the payment menu, you'll see the platform's instant free credit. Now we can experience any proxy on the platform.



You can add payment methodsâ€”I chose Alipay.

**Basic Proxies**

Bright Data enhances complex website data collection success rates through browser API, unlock API, and SERP search engine crawler. It provides multiple proxy networks including dynamic residential IP, data center IP, mobile proxy, and ISP static residential IP, covering 195+ countries/regions globally to ensure efficient, stable, reliable data acquisition.




**Web Scraping API - No-Code Data Scraping**

Select Web Scrapers from the left menu to see many crawler marketplace categories with over 120 API types. I chose `amazon.com` from the e-commerce category.



You can see 13 Amazon crawler APIs.

Click "Amazon products - discover by keyword" to see two scraping methods: left requires manual script execution, right is no-code scraping. I chose no-code scraping.



Enter keyword: SONY WH-1000XM5, click "Start collecting" below to begin scraping.



You can also directly upload CSV files to import dataâ€”**up to 1GB, truly enterprise-grade large-scale crawling**.



Then check scraping status in "Logs". When status shows "Ready", scraping succeeded. Download in "CSV" format.



Scraping results: 261 records total.



**Dataset Marketplace**

Additionally, Bright Data has a ready-made dataset marketplace supporting 130+ common websites, nearly 200 datasets, with 31K+ data samples available for download. Direct useâ€”truly great!



**MCP**

Supports MCP, integrating with Cursor, Claude, n8n, VSCode, and other tools. We can directly input our requirements in tools, and the Agent can directly call MCP to output desired data. For example, in VS Code development tool, after configuring Bright Data's MCP, I input the website or intent I want to scrape in Copilot, and Copilot calls the configured MCP to scrape and output. Here I'm also scraping SONY WH-1000XM5 product data.



### 2. Oxylabs

Oxylabs' Web Scraper API provides $1 credit plus 1GB Web Unblocker quota. Other proxies like residential proxy, ISP, mobile proxy all require payment to operate.



Here I'll use its Web Scraper API to scrape SONY WH-1000XM5 on Amazon e-commerce platform.

Importantly, when using Web Scraper API to scrape data, set USERNAME and PASSWORD as user credentials.



Following the prompt page, I set source as "amazon_search", query as "SONY WH-1000XM5", "start_page":"1","pages":"10".



Enter this command:

```bash
curl 'https://realtime.oxylabs.io/v1/queries' --user 'guilai_DFtRk:Guilai123123_' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"source": "amazon_search", "query": "SONY WH-1000XM5", "geo_location": "90210", "parse": true,"start_page":"1","pages":"10"}' -o result.json
```

If pages are 30, 40, 100, you'll get this promptâ€”**concurrency isn't high**.



Final output results below, scraping speed around 30s.



### 3. ThorData

ThorData provides common residential/mobile/ISP/data center proxies. Its SERP API can scrape mainstream search engines: Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yandex search platforms' results. New users get 2000 results quota. It also provides Web Scraper API, but scrapable websites are only YouTube, Facebook, Amazonâ€”**relatively few API types provided**.



Here I'll use Web Scraper API to scrape SONY WH-1000XM5. Enter keywords and page count, click start scraping.



You can also directly copy the script for local execution. You can see it created a task ID.



After successful scraping, you can see the task's detailed information. Scraping speed: 45s.



Download result as CSV file and view.



### Summary

Through using these three proxies, for beginners, Bright Data is most suitableâ€”provides free credit to experience almost any proxy product. Also, Oxylabs doesn't support high concurrency well, while Bright Data and ThorData handle concurrency decently. ThorData has too few scraping API types, though its scraping speed is fast. Bright Data supports 120+ web scraping APIs with rich variety, though data scraping speed is slightly slower. Overall, Bright Data suits both individuals and enterprises perfectly, suitable for large-scale scraping with very stable scraping process.
